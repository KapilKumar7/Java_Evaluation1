Why String is immutable in java?
Answer -1==>String is a Object in java ,So when we create a string with
the constructor it will  check if there is any other String present
in memory with the same content(i.e String) if there is same String then 
it will give  reference to that  that string from this variable also.
So If the string is mutable then this cannot be done ,because if we change the 
alter the String then it will also alter other variables also who are refer to 
this location also; 
2 ==>So this way it save memory also.  

Difference between String and String Builder?

Write some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.
Ans- Example-String s1 ="Kapil";
s1.toLowerCase();--Convert all character of string to lower case.
s1.toUpperCase();--Convert all character of string to Upper case.
s1.charAt(1); -->Will give you Charater at 1th index.
s1.length(); -->Will return length of s1.
s1.lastIndexOf("i"); -->Will retern last index of i.
